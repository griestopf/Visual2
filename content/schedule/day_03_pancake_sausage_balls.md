Modeling with virtual clay. Inspired by Rony Oren, everything is built out of balls, sausages and pancakes.

## Assignment 

- Build clay lumps out of a control cube and the Subdivision Surface modifier
- Form more (but not too) complex control shapes from the cube by...
  - ...changing to Edit mode
  - ...transforming faces, edges and vertices
  - ...adding Geometry using
    - Extrude
    - Loop Cut and Slide
    - Inset
- Try some simple characters (or only faces) inspired by the Rony Oren books
- Virtually clay-model your physical character from Visual I 
  - Collect reference images and organize them in PureRef
  - Generate T-Pose silhouette images and import them into blender
  - Fragment your character into simple shaped clay lumps
  - Roughly match your clay model's silhouette to the references. Don't go for full congruence. Rather focus on proportions at this stage
  - Model only one half and use the Symmetry

## Questions

- What criteria did you apply for your fragmentation? Show cases where you found it easy and cases where you found it difficult to find a good fragmentation.
- Describe ways to use reference images directly in Blender's 3D view
- Think of other object types than characters. List types that fit well with clay modelling and types that might be hard to clay model
- Explain the settings of the Mirror Modifier and how you adjusted them for your model.
- How many polygons does the Subdivision Surface Modifier create in one step from triangles, quads and n-gons, respectively? Draw how the subdivision of each of these face types is performed.

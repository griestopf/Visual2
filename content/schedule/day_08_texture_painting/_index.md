Paint your characters base colors on a two-dimensional image.

## Assignment 

- With a decent UV layout for your character...
- Switch to Texture Paint
- In the Multiresolution modifier, set the viewport detail to a rather low resolution (1 or 2) 
- Add a new all-white or -black texture to your model.
  - Use a decent resolution (2048 x 2048 px)
- Get familiar with the painting process in 2D and 3D view
- Find images with a good color impression how you want your models to look like
  - Ideally without much lighting influence (no shadows, no highlights)
  - Use them as stencil to paint complex image parts on your texture

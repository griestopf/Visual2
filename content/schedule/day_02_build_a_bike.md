Get familiar with navigating in 3D and using built-in 3D-objects (*primitives*) to block-out simple models.

## Assignment 

- Build a Bike. Or something similar: A complex shape made out of simple primitives: Tubes, bars, donuts, etc. (Examples: desk lamp, catapult, fork lift)
  - Use the built-in primitive geometries. Move, rotate, scale them
  - Use the "Base Point Snapping" feature to align objects
  - Use Hierarchy (parenting) to group objects to parts 
  - Transform objects' origins to ease alignment
  - Use the "Transformation orientation" and "Transform Pivot Point" settings
  - Use with consideration and rarely: boolean modifiers to generate new shapes


## Questions

- Explain a good way to radially and evenly distribute the tube shaped spokes of a wheel!
- Explain the various parameters of each geometry primitive in the respective [_Adjust Last Operation panel_](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/regions.html)!
- Where in your model did you use parent-child relationships and why?
- Why is the boolean modifier called "boolean"? What are the three "boolean" (or rather, set-) operations

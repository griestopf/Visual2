Generate a simple geometry made out of quads only with edge loops following your character's features.

## Assignment 

- Retopologize your model
  - Name your existing model "..._orig"
  - Start from scratch with a plane-only object. Name it "..._retopo"
  - Set snapping settings to have edits on the new ("...retopo") object slide on your "...orig" object
  - Set the visibility settings 
    - to backface culling (to only see the front of the faces), 
    - to let the retopo object always appear on top and 
    - to display it with a custom (highlight) color
  - Use the Poly Build tool in edit mode to build structures
  - Use the Fill and Grid Fill commands
  - Create ONLY QUADS. No Tris, no n-gons. Quads. 
- Find tutorials on 
  - "good" topology
  - importance of quads

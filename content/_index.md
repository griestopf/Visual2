Welcome to the Visual 2 module's web site.

In this module we will learn how to create a 3D character and export it as a game asset. We will use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as the main content creation tool. To verify that our asset can be used in a game engine, we will use [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) as an example game engine. 

Topics covered in detail in this module are

- Introduction into Blender
- Virtual clay modeling
- Sculpting
- Retopology
- UV-Unwrapping
- Texturing
- Game-Engine Export 



We will *not* learn how to setup our 3D model for animation nor will we animate it during this course. Animation will be covered in subsequent modules.

Requirements

- A decent (not necessarily high-end) laptop or desktop computer running a contemporary operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Latest versions of Blender and Godot installed
- A 3-button mouse with mouse wheel. Ideally the middle mouse button is seperated from the mouse wheel (at least on Windows and Linux. Blender on macOS handles apple mice in a special way).
- Preferably a keyboard with a separate numeric keypad. If your Laptop doesn't have a seperate keypad, consider buying a cheap extra pad.

Additional hardware. This is not required but can be helpful for students planning focus on 3D modeling.

- Graphics tablet
- Space Mouse
